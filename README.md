# homeworksheet
A randomly generated worksheet we use for my son's homeschooling

This is meant to be run, obviously, as a Mac application, although it is really just the python script inside.  It assumes, also, that you have Open Office installed, and it calls that binary at the very end to make it literally a one-click, randomized worksheet.
